Insights and Analysis
1. Sales & Revenue Analysis

Revenue by Product Type: The skincare product line is the highest revenue generator, accounting for 41.83% of the total revenue. This is followed by haircare at 

30.2% and cosmetics at 27.96%.


Performance by Location: While Kolkata has the highest number of products sold (13K), Mumbai generates slightly more revenue (137.76K) with fewer sales (9K), suggesting a higher price per unit or a more profitable product mix in that region.

2. Inventory & Production Analysis

Production Volumes: Production is led by skincare with 24K units, followed by haircare (20K) and cosmetics (12K).


Sales vs. Availability: There is a significant surplus of stock for all product types. For instance, skincare has 21K units available in stock but only 2K units sold, indicating potential overstocking or a need for better sales strategies.

3. Logistics & Quality Control

Transportation Modes: The distribution network uses a balanced mix of transportation methods: Road (29%), Air (28%), and Sea (26%), with Rail (17%) being used less frequently.


Shipping Routes: Route A is the dominant logistics channel, responsible for 43% of all product movements.


Inspection Results: A major bottleneck appears to be in quality control, as 41% of products are still pending inspection. Of the inspected products, 36% passed while 23% failed.


Shipping Times: Skincare products have the longest shipping time (213), while cosmetics have the shortest (171).
